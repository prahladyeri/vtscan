# Installation

# Usage

![sample screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prahladyeri/vtscan/master/screenshot.png)


# Notes

You'll need a VirusTotal API key to use this program. For this, you'll have to register a free account at [https://www.virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com). Once you have the API key, you just put it in the `config.json` which is found at package install path upon installation. On Windows OS, this path typically works out to:

```bash
"%LocalAppData%\Programs\Python\PythonX-Y\Lib\site-packages\vtscan
```
